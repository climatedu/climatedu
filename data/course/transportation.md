## Public vs. private transportation


### Where do most of our emissions come from?

	

If you recall from the energy section, one of the biggest causes for the rising global temperature is fossil fuels. Thus, to prevent the planet from warming up even more, humans must decarbonize.

Greenhouse gases come from all sorts of sources. However, the amount of emissions that come from transportation may surprise you. Take a look at the following brochure from the American Public Transportation Association to learn about the issue with transportation and how public transportation can help.

Right now in the United States, 28% of carbon emissions come from transportation. The United States has emitted the most amount of total carbon dioxide globally.

Next, let's analyze a few graphics from this [blog post](https://www.wri.org/blog/2019/10/everything-you-need-know-about-fastest-growing-source-global-emissions-transport) from the World Resources Institute:

**Q: What patterns do you see? Why is this the case? Why do some high and upper middle-income countries have such a small amount of emissions?**

We can reduce our carbon emissions from transportation in a number of ways—one of the main solutions people have been looking at is public transportation. Although the United States currently has a lot of public transportation, it is being used significantly less than other nations such as the UK.

**Q: How do you think your local, state, and national government can help increase the use of public transportation?**

Take a look at this article to learn more about the relationship between climate change and transportation, and read the second article to learn more about the benefits of public transportation.

In fact, we could get rid of our carbon emissions altogether. One solution that could get us there is the zero-carbon grid. The zero-carbon grid combines onshore wind, offshore wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, nuclear, hydro and optimizes them to run everything, including our vehicles. Watch this video to learn about how the zero-carbon grid works and how it can help us.

## Solutions

Of course, it is going to be extremely difficult for the world to just suddenly get rid of cars. However, because of how long this issue has been left unattended, slower approaches to shifting away from carbon-emitting transportation will not be enough. One popular solution is to not get rid of cars, but replace our current cars with environmentally friendly cars. Yet if we do get rid of cars, we will have to improve on other modes of transportation —  especially public transportation. 

Humans have always been drawn to cities —  centers of innovation and commerce that bring large amounts of change. Yet cities are huge contributors to climate change, consuming 80% of Earth's energy. There needs to be a drastic change in the way humans move and live in urban areas. Read this article that was written in 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic about developing a car-free city.

Some of you may have already heard of Electric-Vehicle (EV) batteries. EV batteries power the electric motors of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) and are the accepted replacement for the internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles —  vehicles that use gasoline or diesel.  To learn more about these different types of electric vehicles, take a look at the following guide from EVgo.



*   [Types of Electric Vehicles](https://www.evgo.com/why-evs/types-of-electric-vehicles/), EVgo article

The battery system is one of the most important parts of an EV. EV batteries are rechargeable due to a reversible chemical reaction. This chemical process makes it possible to discharge and charge the battery. When discharging, electrical current flows from cathode (+) to anode (-). When charging, the electrical current flows from anode (-) to cathode (+). The most common type of EV battery is lithium-ion, but there are also lead-acid, nickel-metal hydride, zebra, and more. 

More and more people are buying and using EVs to replace their ICE vehicles.

Let's take a look at more data on EVs in 2020 from Bloomberg NEF.

Finally, here are some cool things happening in the world of EV batteries:



1. Europe has plans for heavy investment in electric vehicle battery development and production, and Indonesia also aims to produce electric vehicle batteries in 2023, inviting Chinese battery firm GEM and Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd to invest in Indonesia.
2. President Barack Obama announced in 2009 that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act will fund 2.4 billion US dollars for  48 new advanced battery and electric drive projects. This marked the single largest investment in advanced battery technology for HEVs and BEVs ever made as of 2020.
