# Food

What was the last meal you had? Maybe it was a yummy breakfast of eggs and toast, or a hamburger and french fries for dinner. Have ever you thought about all the things that went into you eating that hamburger? What did it take to get to your plate? This section will dive into the environmental impacts of food, from water usage to food transportation to food waste. We will go through the farm to table process, analyzing the climate implications of every step. Let’s go!

## Land/water usage

First, let’s look at the foundation of so much on our planet - water. You’ve probably heard something like this before: 71% of Earth’s surface is covered in water. But is it all clean or usable for food and drinking? Could we run out of water for this purpose? Watch this Ted-Ed video and be prepared to answer a few questions afterwards.

Here’s some food for thought:

**Q: What are some of the sources of freshwater that are accessible to humans? Did you know about all of them? If you didn’t know about one or more of them, maybe look them up and read an article!**

**Q: Set a timer for 2 minutes and write down a list of how many things you use water for every day. What did you come up with? What are some ways you can reduce your water consumption?**

<textarea placeholder="Preview submission area. Answers are not saved."></textarea>

In addition to our water, the relationship between humans and the land is complex and interconnected: our usage of the land affects the climate, and in turn, the climate impacts how we can use the land. This is seen in wildfires and deforestation which have been touched on a bit in previous sections. The land plays a pivotal role in what foods we are able to grow, how people are able to live, and the overall health of our climate. Watch this video by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the connection between land usage and water.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EMFCbjPb5ng" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

How did the images throughout the video make you feel? What were you surprised by? Summarize some of the adverse land effects of climate change and the implications (hint: what happens with extreme wealth events? How does that affect food security?).

Something to note before we move on is the connection between deforestation and land usage. Agriculture requires a lot of land - space to grow crops for animals, space to grow crops for human usage, space for animals to live, etc. The land needs to be flat, cleared land to be usable for modern agriculture. As you can probably imagine, forests are often cut down. leading to habitat loss and other dangerous impacts you learned in the deforestation-specific section. You will learn more about some of this in detail throughout the rest of the section.

## Diet

Next let’s talk about how our diet impacts the climate. What is the climate impact of the food we eat? How can we improve our diets to be less harmful to the environment? Does it really make a difference? Watch this video from Climate Lab about how your diet is connected to climate change and what changes you can make to be more environmentally conscious. Then, watch the Center for Investigative Reporting video that dives deeper into the climate impact of beef.

To see what you learned, take [this quiz ](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/longform/quiz-do-you-know-how-your-diet-affects-planet)associated with the Climate Lab. Good luck!

Are you surprised? What did you learn? I think when we think about the environmental costs of our food, a lot of us don’t think about the land used to grow the food for the animals, the fertilizers needed, or the water required for the animals. There are so many different components discussed in that video, so you might even want to watch it again to make sure you understand everything.

Reflecting on what you’ve just learned about agricultural emissions and land use, what are your two biggest takeaways? Take some time to consider how learning this information makes you feel and what you can do to potentially change your lifestyle or inform others.

## Food transportation

Alright, so now we know about the land and water needed to grow or manufacture the good, whether it is plant based or meat. How is that food transported? How does your food get from where it is produced to your house? Brainstorm a quick list of some of the intermittent steps that need to happen in the food transportation process.

After you’ve made your list, read this article from Harvard University about a concept called “Food Miles.” While reading, make a list of some vocabulary words or keywords relating to food transportation, food miles, etc.

- [Harvard Article about Food Miles](https://green.harvard.edu/news/do-food-miles-really-matter)

Here’s a brief list of some things you might have written down. Compare your list to ours:

- Local Food Movement
- Food Miles (Food Carbon Footprint)
- Carbon Costs of Production
- Consumption of Animal Products

Below is another article from the State of Oregon Department of Environmental Quality that discusses some of the same topics but provides some insight into different methods of transportation, the distribution of energy used by the food system, and consumer shopping impacts. When you are reading, briefly write down what you’ve learned and any conclusions you’ve come to. After watching another video, you’ll be writing a short paragraph reflection of these sources.

- [Food Transportation Review Sheet](https://www.oregon.gov/deq/FilterDocs/PEF-FoodTransportation-ExecutiveSummary.pdf), Oregon.gov

If you are interested in this topic or want to hear another perspective, watch the following Ted Talk with environmental studies professor Peter Newton. If you want to write any points down for your reflection, you can, but you can also just watch.

**Q: Write a reflection about what you learned or things you found interesting. Below are a few things to consider:**

- **What are food miles? What are sources of pollution in the food production and transportation process?**
- **What are some of the solutions in regard to pollution relating to food mentioned? What do you think is the best plan forward in this area?**
- **What are some benefits and drawbacks to buying local food? In your opinion, how much of our food should we be buying locally?**

## Food waste

Next step on our journey: food waste. When you are done eating your dinner at a restaurant, what does your plate typically look like? Is it fully clear or do you have some food left? Now scale that up to everyone in your state, your country, or even bigger. How much food do you think goes uneaten? You just learned about the climate image of producing food on the environment, but what about food waste? Watch this video from Climate Lab to learn about the food waste problem and a few solutions.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6RlxySFrkIM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

That video was super interesting, right? Reflect on some of the solutions they gave and the points they raised. What did you learn? What did you find interesting? How does this change your mindset about food?

Here are a few short podcast episodes (about a minute each) that focus on 3 solutions to reduce food waste associated with behavioral psychology. Listen to each of them and be prepared to answer a few questions afterward.

- [UC Science Today Podcast Episodes](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/longform/how-behavioral-psychology-can-help-stop-food-waste)

The first podcast focused on smaller apples, the second on removing trays, and the third on composting.

**Q: Which of the solutions did you like the most? Which do you think would be most effective? How does behavioral psychology play a role in bringing about these changes?**

## Farms of the Future

Next, we are going to watch some videos about potential solutions to these issues. The first one is a TedEd video about creating a perfect farm. This video focuses on innovative ways that countries around the world were changing their farming practices to be more eco-friendly, such as smart crop monitoring, intertwining animals and a variety of crops.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xFqecEtdGZ0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

What did you think of the innovative farming techniques? What surprised you about them?

**Q: Pick one of the countries mentioned, and describe their developments and the benefits.**

If you think about combating climate change, the first thing you’d probably think of is some sort of emission reduction—less fossil fuels being burned, less waste, something like that. But what about all of the carbon that is already in the atmosphere? One drawdown technique is regenerative agriculture. Regenerative agriculture looks to reverse climate change by taking carbon out of the atmosphere and trapping it in the soil. Let's watch this video to learn a little more!

- [Can regenerative agriculture reverse climate change?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuRpEA1sFow), NowThis video

As you learned in the video, the goal of regenerative agriculture is to capture the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, trap it in the soil, where it can have benefits of its own, like increased biodiversity, greater nutrients, and less soil destruction. The video mentioned four techniques: crop rotation, the elimination of chemical fertilizers, usage of compost, cover cropping, and usage of animals. Which technique did you find most interesting? Pick one method and explain the reasoning behind it.

How is the yield different between conventional farming and organic farming? How did that change over time? If you are interested in this topic, check out [this site.](https://regenerationinternational.org/)

**Permaculture** is a bit tricky to define, but involves creating solutions that allow us to work with our surroundings, with nature, as opposed to against it. We want to allow the land and humans to work together and provide mutual benefit. Watch this following video from Our Changing Climate and read the article to learn a bit more about permaculture.

Throughout this chapter of the course, we’ve talked a lot about meat and land farming. But that’s not the only place you might get your food from. Maybe you’ve gone fishing before in a lake with your family, but probably released the fish back. So where do the fish we eat come from? Watch the following TED-Ed video about aquaculture (aquatic farming).

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JYZpxRy5Mfg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**Q: Pick one of the following: large pens offshore, man-made coastal pods, and fish farming on land. What are the benefits and drawbacks of your chosen method?**

In this chapter, we hope to have given you a good understanding of the climate impacts of our food, and everything that is behind a plate of food on your dinner table. In the Farms of the Future section, you’ve been introduced to a number of different techniques and innovative strategies, but these are certainly not all. If there is one you are particularly interested in, do more research and learn about it! There’s always more to learn.
