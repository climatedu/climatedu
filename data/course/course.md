## Mental health resources

Climate change can be a scary subject, and itâ€™s not unusual to feel anxious, sad, afraid, or depressed while discussing it. While it is important to be educated about climate change, it's even more important to take care of your own mental health. Before we begin, here are some tips on how you can take care of yourself while learning to take care of the planet:

- Be open to discussions about how you feel with your friends, family, and teachers. You are not alone in your concern for the environment.
- Stay educated about climate change, but do so in moderation. Don't feel like you need to stay up to date with every devastating news headline! Stress can motivate us to take action, but it can also lead to burnout.
- Prioritize researching solutions over forecasts and predictions, and take action! You are not powerless in fighting climate change. In this curriculum, you will learn about changes you can take individually, as well as larger-scale projects that you can advocate for.
- Remember that there are many people, organizations, and politicians who support climate science and who are pursuing the solutions outlined in this curriculum! Saving the planet is an urgent and daunting task, but your teammates are working hard right beside you.
- Value your own mental health. Make time to exercise, spend time in nature, pursue hobbies, sleep and eat well, keep mindful limits on screen time, and spend time with friends and family.
