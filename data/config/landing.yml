faq:
  - question: Who is this course most suitable for?
    answer:
      We developed this course with middle and high school students in mind. That
      being said, it's never too early (or too late!) to learn about our planet and
      how to better protect it. As parents, feel free to go through these materials
      with a younger student. We learned quite a bit while researching and composing the
      course -- adults, teens, and children alike can benefit from these resources.
  - question: I'm a teacher. How can I create my own virtual classroom with climatedu?
    answer:
      "Users can choose to create one of two types of accounts: (1) teacher accounts,
      and (2) student accounts. When you register as a teacher, you'll also choose
      a unique class code and share it with the students in your class. Students can
      use these codes to join classes from their dashboard after logging into their
      account. You'll be able to see students' course progress, as well as their written
      prompt responses. You'll also be able to provide feedback and approve course
      completion."
  - question: I'm a student. What if I'm not in a formal class?
    answer:
      Instead of having a teacher review the your responses and approve course
      completion, our team will review the responses of any independent student. We’ll
      be your teachers, and you can ask us questions anytime at hello@climatedu.org!
  - question: I'm a student. What do I get for completing this course?
    answer:
      First, you'll be equipped with the knowledge to effectively identify and
      address climate issues that our society faces today. You'll be able to teach others
      about these issues, too! You'll also receive a certificate upon completion, and
      a package of sustainable incentives (while supplies last).
  - question: Where should I go to report an issue, ask a question, or leave feedback?
    answer:
      Our team is available at hello@climatedu.org, or leave a message by visiting
      the "Contact Us" page. Happy inquiring!
  - question: How long does this course take to complete?
    answer:
      Our course has seven units. If you're consistently spending one or two hours
      per day on the material, you should be able to finish in a few weeks. However,
      everyone moves at their own pace when learning new knowledge, so don't be surprised
      if you take more time (or less time!) to make it through the full course.
