Hi there,

I'm Vivian Li, and I started this intiative for my Girl Scout Gold Award project in hopes of providing a consolidated resource for kids seeking to learn about climate change and sustainability. I reached out to a few of my friends in July, and we've been working day and night since to make this aspiration a reality. I'm deeply thankful for all of the friends and mentors who have provided guidance and effortful contributions along the way (you can learn more about them on the Our Team page), and I hope you, as the reader, will benefit from the value their work as well.

We're running out of time make the changes and catalyze the solutions that can save our planet from irreversible damage. As a society, we are ill-equipped to address these climate issues simply because it's hard to conceptualize how close these dooming impacts really are. We're motivated by crisis, not prevention. This course utilizes the psychology behind understanding climate change and lays out why we need climate action and climate legislation today--why prevention is our only option.

Climate change is also an issue of equity. Communities of color and communities of lower socioeconomic status are hit the hardest by the climate crisis, and addressing climate issues goes hand in hand with addressing social justice issues that discriminate against BIPOC. Until we are able to uplift our BIPOC communities, we have no environmental justice.

These global issues are certainly dire, but they're also endlessly intriguing. Moreover, the solutions to these issues are beyond fun. As we educate students, we aim not only to inform, but also to inspire and entertain. We want students to feel genuinely invested in the resources that they're exploring, and our hope is that this course won't mark the end to their quest in learning about our planet. We hope that they will feel the urge to study further and test the limits of our society's knowledge. We hope that they will immerse themselves in the innovative and collaborative solutions of the future that are coming together as we speak. This course is only a beginning.

Thank you for taking the time to read this message, and I hope you find this resource useful. Happy learning!
